# pfpet

A quick and easy way to apply filters to your friend's online avatars!
Just place their username/id in the right route and voilÃ , you have their avatar being petted or bonked or what have you.

Current base URL: `https://pfpet.msterling.dev/`

## Endpoints

> Note: The `.gif` extension in the URL is required because the Discord client will only render as a static image if there is no "extension".
